#
# TARGET         the target directory that'll be monitored
# WATCHES        what should be monitored (CLOSE_WRITE, MOVED_TO, MOVED_FROM or DELETE)
# SPAWN          program that'll be spawn having the new item in question as argument
# LOOKAT         what will be looked at inside the target directory (FILES, DIRS)
# ACCEPT_REGEX   regex that shall be matched on the new item
# RECURSIVE      should this rule apply to subdirectories too? (YES, NO)
#
# NOTE: The parser expects the entries to be ordered (TARGET,WATCHES,SPAWN,LOOKAT and
# then ACCEPT_REGEX). If you want more flexibility, go enhance the parser yourself :)
